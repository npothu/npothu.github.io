# Welcome

Hey everyone! I'm Nathan Pothuganti, and this is my personal website. This website will tell you more about myself and will contain documentation for my projects in programming and electronics. 


I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech and expecting to graduate in 2028. I'm interested in software engineering and love to create things. I am from Pembroke Pines, Florida, and love cook and run (though as a freshman, I really only make fried rice and eggs).
