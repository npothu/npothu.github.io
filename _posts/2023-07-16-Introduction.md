# Welcome

Hey everyone! I'm Nathan Pothuganti, and this is my personal website. This website will tell you more about myself and will contain documentation for my projects in programming and electronics. 


I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech and expecting to graduate in 2028. I'm interested in software engineering and love to create things. I am from Pembroke Pines, Florida, and love cook and run (though as a freshman, I really only make fried rice and eggs). 

Career Goals:

I aim to become a principal software engineer at a tech company like Apple. To have the necessary knowledge, I will take software-related concentrations in my major like Systems & Architecture and Distrubuted Systems & Software Design.  I will join a VIP (research team) to learn more about my field and apply my knowledge. After participating in a few internships, I hope to gain enough experience to land a good software engineering job, followed by several years in the industry to advance my career. 

I hope to maintain an interest in making things. I want to be crafty, and able to create household objects like simple furniture and organizers using machinery. I will become a peer instructor at the Hive, the ECE makerspace, and work on various projects while gaining experience with diffirent machines.
