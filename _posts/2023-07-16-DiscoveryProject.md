# The Idea

A digital clock that is inspired by old nixie-tube clocks.  Each digit slot (4 digits) has 11 sheets of acrylic etched numbers 0-9 respectively, and a back sheet that is set to transparent or dark.
The sheets each have 2 respective LEDs to diffuse light to display the correct combination of digits. This means 44 LEDS.  
The image above shows a design I would like to replicate (but hours + minutes only). 

# Skills and Tools Utilized

Skills I will utilize during this process include:
- PCB Design and Fabrication
- Microcontroller programming
- Basic 3D-printing & laser-cutting
- Soldering

# The Process

To start, I decided that I figure out how to design my PCB. To do so, I learned how to create a PCB using Altium Designer with help from peer instructors at the HIVE.
The PCB design should look similar to the product below:

Here is the schematic I created for my PCB. The PCB schematic shows the 22 LEDs in series. There will be four of these PCBs daisy chained, meaning that 88 LEDs will be in series. However, this is not an issue as only 16 LEDs would ever be on at the same time (if the backlight is on, otherwise only 8).

My PCB layout will not have VOs. I decided to do this because the PCB printers at the HIVE are limited in their ability to do that. I plan to use the HIVE printers to learn how the machines function, and to have a prototype to mess with before ordering the real things. 

Because the order made for my PCBs and LEDs will take a while to arrive, my progress is shifted to the design of my casing.
