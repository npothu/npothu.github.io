# The Idea

A digital clock that is inspired by old nixie-tube clocks.  Each digit slot (4 digits) has 11 sheets of acrylic etched numbers 0-9 respectively, and a back sheet that is set to transparent or dark.
The sheets each have 2 respective LEDs to diffuse light to display the correct combination of digits. This means 44 LEDS.  

The image below shows a design I would like to replicate (but hours + minutes only).

# The Process

To start, I decided that I figure out how to design my PCB. To do so, I learned how to create a PCB using Altium Designer with help from people at the HIVE.
The PCB design should look similar to the product below:
