# Overview
This is a project I pursued by myself while at the RDF Lab @ FIU. I was inspired by [Stuff Made Here's](https://youtu.be/cQO2XTP7QDw) handwriting forgery robot (though, I do not use machine learning.) An application for this code + end effector includes quickly creating large, customizable label prints. This can be highly adaptive to work with a number of diffirent insturments (pens, penicls, paint brushes, glue guns, razors) and can be used for diffirent materials. An owner of a co-robot has a lot of flexibility for what they could utilize this program for.
