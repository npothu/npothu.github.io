# Career Goals

I aim to become a principal software engineer at a tech company like Apple. To have the necessary knowledge, I will take software-related concentrations in my major like Systems & Architecture and Distrubuted Systems & Software Design.  I will join a VIP (research team) to learn more about my field and apply my knowledge. After participating in a few internships, I hope to gain enough experience to land a good software engineering job, followed by several years in the industry to advance my career. 

I hope to maintain an interest in making things. I want to be crafty, and able to create household objects like simple furniture and organizers using machinery. I will become a peer instructor at the Hive, the ECE makerspace, and work on various projects while gaining experience with diffirent machines.
